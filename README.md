# Hi I'm Mahfujur Rahman
While i was developing a Prescription Generation System for a doctor, I suffered to collect the drug's database.
So, i have created this dataset which contain <h6>Drug's Name, Drug's MG, Generic Name, Company's Name etc.</h6>
This dataset can be used for the analytical purpose of Bangladesh's Pharmaceutical Company like
 <h5> You can identify the biggest company in Bangladesh.</h5>
 N.B: <h4> Preprocess the cell's values for medicine type and price if you need </h4>
 
 ##### For coverting the .CSV file to mysql database file
